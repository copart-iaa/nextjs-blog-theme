## DALLAS - Copart


DALLAS - Copart, (NASDAQ: CPRT) a global leader in online auto auctions, is hiring 225 tow and transport drivers/loaders from across the country, and is willing to provide the needed training for the job.

“If someone has a solid work ethic and a desire to succeed, we can teach them everything else,” said Simon Smock, Director of Operations for Copart North America. Copart will pay for successful applicants to earn their commercial driver’s license (CDL) to drive vehicle transporters and to obtain certifications to operate front-end loaders as well.

These new hires will drive and load brand new equipment to transport vehicles between Copart locations and to Copart buyers. In the event of an emergency like a hurricane, flood or hailstorm, these new employees will remove vehicles from the affected areas and bring them to Copart locations. When not transporting vehicles, they will assist with inventory management efforts at Copart’s facilities across the country.

These new positions pay highly competitive wages and include benefits such as health & life insurance, 401k retirement plans, and an employee stock purchase program. With Copart’s commission system, weekly bonuses and daily per-diem, a driver can earn $85,000 a year or more. These positions are expected to require travel about 25% of the time.

“This is a great opportunity for someone starting out, someone fresh out of the military, or just someone who needs a change,” Smock said. “If that sounds like you, we’d love to talk to you.”


Founded in 1982, Copart operates more than 200 locations around the world. Last year, Copart transported more than 3 million vehicles globally.
